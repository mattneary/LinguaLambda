						<h3>A Derivation of Macros in a Non-Commutative Space</h3>
						<p>The Rubik's Cube is the quintessential group, that is, it perfectly exhibits the complications of exclusively non-commutative operations on an algebraic space. Hence solving a Rubik's cube, i.e., inverting a given permutation of a cube, is very non-trivial; however, with the right motivations, one can find algorithms that will manipulate the cube in useful ways, allowing one to gradually approach a solved cube.</p>

						<h3>Enhancing the Lambda Calculus from Within</h3>
						<p>Lambda Calculus is a very bare-bones language, and at first sight it seems full-fledged programs would be impossible in such a syntactically restrictive language. Now clearly by the ideas of Turing Completeness and the Church-Turing Thesis, this is far from the truth. Rather, as I wish to make clear, with abstractions constructed from within the language, we can make a more welcoming environment for development.</p>

						<h3>On the Interpretation of the Lambda Calculus</h3>
						<p>The idea of computational equivalency was first suggested by Alan Turing; it has since played a fundamental role in our understanding of computation. Turing proposed the idea of universal computation machines, now known by the name of Universal Turing Machines, saying that some mechanical devices are capable of simulating all others. A profound concept which we will take advantage of in our interpretation of one language within another.</p>

						<h3>On Cardinality Proofs of Elementary Sets</h3>
						<p>There is a famous work by Russell which laboriously builds from a few axioms the rudiments of Mathematics. Inspired by the sarcastic question, "What's 2+2?", I put together a not-quite-so-rigorous proof of this rudimentary fact. The approach we will take involves the Axiom of Choice (unfortunately), an inductive definition of cardinality sets, and an inductive definition of addition.</p>

						<h3>A Bootstrapped Interpreter of Lambda Calculus</h3>
						<p>The beauty of Turing Complete languages is that they are capable of interpreting any programming language, including themselves. This means that the feature set of a lambda calculus interpreter could be expanded from within the familiar syntax of lambda calculus, for example. Realistically, there is probably not a good use of such an interpreter, but it is undoubtedly a worthy exercise in the language.</p>

						<h3>A Primer on the Structure and Interpretation of Programs</h3>
						<p>"The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program."<sup>1</sup>
						<br>"A function is a rule of correspondence ... that is, a function is an operation that may be applied to one thing ... to yield another thing."<sup>2</sup>
						<br>The above serve as outlooks on the concepts surrounding computation approximately corresponding to the two original theories of computation, that of Turing and that of Church.</p>
