	  <h3>Translating Programs from Imperative to Functional Style</h3>
	  <span>&raquo; 08 Aug 2013</span>
	  <p>There are two basic approaches to programming, derived from the two original theories of computation. The approach more familiar to most programmers is imperative; however, this is mostly due to the prevalence of certain languages and perhaps the less steep learning curve of the approach. Functional programming is just as robust, often more succinct, and almost always renders a more easily tested product.</p>

	  <h3>Testing JSON APIs with Quizzical</h3>
	  <span>&raquo; 15 Jul 2013</span>
	  <p>Testing is a very important part of development that aims to verify your code. Beyond that, testing also takes away any fear of refactoring, assuring that you don't break anything. Despite these benefits, some developers find it too much an inconvenience to bother with, especially when dealing with complex problems like asynchronicity and concurrency. However, the tool I've been working on, Quizzical, is a suite of scripts that aims to make writing these tests as easy as possible.</p>

	  <h3>A Derivation of Macros in a Non-Commutative Space</h3>
	  <span>&raquo; 18 Jun 2013</span>
	  <p>The Rubik's Cube is the quintessential group, that is, it perfectly exhibits the complications of exclusively non-commutative operations on an algebraic space. Hence solving a Rubik's cube, i.e., inverting a given permutation of a cube, is very non-trivial; however, with the right motivations, one can find algorithms that will manipulate the cube in useful ways, allowing one to gradually approach a solved cube.</p>

	  <p>"The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program."1 <br> "A function is a rule of correspondence ... that is, a function is an operation that may be applied to one thing ... to yield another thing."2 <br> The above serve as outlooks on the concepts surrounding computation approximately corresponding to the two original theories of computation, that of Turing and that of Church.</p>

	  <h3>On Cardinality Proofs of Elementary Sets</h3>
	  <span>&raquo; 14 May 2013</span>
	  <p>There is a famous work by Russell which laboriously builds from a few axioms the rudiments of Mathematics. Inspired by the sarcastic question, "What's 2+2?", I put together a not-quite-so-rigorous proof of this rudimentary fact. The approach we will take involves the Axiom of Choice (unfortunately), an inductive definition of cardinality sets, and an inductive definition of addition.</p>

	  <h3>A Bottom-Up Approach to Programming in Lambda Calculus</h3>
	  <span>&raquo; 01 May 2013</span>
	  <p>Lambda Calculus is a very bare-bones language, and at first sight it seems full-fledged programs would be impossible in such a syntactically restrictive language. Now clearly by the ideas of Turing Completeness and the Church-Turing Thesis, this is far from the truth. Rather, as I wish to make clear, we can make a more welcoming environment for development with abstractions constructed from within the language.</p>

	  <h3>On the Interpretation of Lambda Calculus</h3>
	  <span>&raquo; 18 Apr 2013</span>
	  <p>The idea of computational equivalency was first suggested by Alan Turing; it has since played a fundamental role in our understanding of computation. Turing proposed the idea of universal computation machines, now known by the name of Universal Turing Machines, saying that some mechanical devices are capable of simulating all others. A profound concept which we will take advantage of in our interpretation of one language within another.</p>
